# IEEE_754_Half_Precision_Adder
""" 1)This is a python program to create Half Precision IEEE 754 Floating point adder.
    2)All the four stages have been implemented and commented in the code also and each conversion
      and variables named accordingly.
    3) The code is limited to 3 floating point precision inputs only
    4)Enter the two rounded inputs with appropriate signs in the stage1  section of the code.Ex. stage1(93, 78)
    5)Then run the code and note down the results in the output console.
    6)The first output line includes the representation of the num1 in the form sign,ieee_exponent,
    ieee_mantissa and regular exponent value in integer format.
    7)The second output line includes the representation of the num2 in the form sign,ieee_exponent,
    ieee_mantissa and regular exponent value in integer format.
    8)The third output line the smaller exponent number adjusted in the form sign,ieee_exponent,
    ieee_mantissa and regular exponent value in integer format
    9)The fourth output line indicates the larger exponent number in the form in the form sign,ieee_exponent,
    ieee_mantissa and regular exponent value in integer format
    10)The fifth and the sixth lines include if we are taking two's complement or not and if taking it
    includes the result of the addition in the standard IEEE 754 format without normalizing.
    11)The last line indicates the final answer after addition and Normalization in the standard
       IEEE 754 Half Precision Format
